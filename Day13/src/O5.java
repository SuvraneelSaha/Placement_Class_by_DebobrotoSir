        user doesnt get to know that there is no coding
        making the code so simply
        representation should be so simple that
        we cant even understand whats inside

        in this case no error message should be meant to display

        if we take t= -1 then
        we increment the t first
        then take the value in the array




// not only coding is important
// understanding the process is also important

// -1 is the t's starting point
// for ease


// edge cases --
//1 if the user inputs a character instead of a number
//2 if the user delete without inserting anything



there is no actual delete of an element
t is actually
