Streams in Explore - Java and Python 
also .net  and also it ifrastructure services 

these are foundation streams 
SQL and also PL SQL 

html css javascript 

in sql part python - mysql and for java - oracle 

can we go for both - yes you can 
its your choice but dont jump around 
stick to one 
1st focus on 1 programming language 
in the 1st proctored test - go for java 
then in the 2nd proctored test - go for python track 

What is learning 
your persception of learning vs explore learning 

learning happens by performing hands on problems 
and building solutions to your problems 

can you apply the knowledge to real world problems to solve 
what you can apply to solve real time problems 

how can you reach there 

it can happen only through practicing 
practice more and more 
unix , sql , python , java 

just refering the content , pdf wathcing 

go for the practical
engage your hands and your brain to solve it 
crack those errors 
and build solns 

its all about hands on 
less and limited theory and lots of hand on training 

Java - 
data types 
varaible decelration 
conditions 
iterations 
little oops 

python -  
methods funtions 
tuples 


in academics you need in depth 
in case of real life - you need lots of hands on and less on theory 

keep that in mind 

For engagement - minimum 2 webinar on technology webinar 

next week onwards 

stay tuned for the mails 

Evening - check community in TCS 

Hackathons and coding challenges are very good to train and make you vigilent 

python hackathon is present on friday coming friday 

participation is must 

there is nothing to loose 

doesnt matter if the score is 0 learning and hiit is important 

You are there to validate yourself 

30 th dec - python programming hackathon also check the announcements 


Courses - 
UNIX 
UI - js , html and css 
Python 
Java 
SQL 
PL - SQL 




hands on integrated - 
integrated hackkerrank platform 
with TCS 

ion hands on itself - tcs environment 
nqt hands on part 
just like nqt exam type 

also assessments are also present - just like a proctored assessment 

any time according to your conveniences 

Devote every day to learning at least twice learn  it will compound and give you benefits 

tuesday and wednesday - technical sessions 

friday - python hackathon event 

What is the best learning approach 
what to do how to do ?

1st assessment - 18 - 20 of Janauary 
every 2 or 3 weeks assesement will be there 
IPA exams search ?

ex - java - candidate scored 55+ but <80 

then he/she decided focus on python in the 2nd IPA - in Python attempt 
score was 30 or 40 < 55 

so java score is better 

in 3rd attempt lets try again in java IPA exam <50 
Now what will Happen 

Lets again go for python 4th time - 80+ in python 

good excited - 

now again 5th time java - score < 55 
it is month of april what will happen 

now you have to join TCS what will happen 

how tcs will consider - it will consider the best score - python 80+ will win 
assosiative will get 60 k + incentive 

if 55+ java - 40k bonus 

incentive will be tagged to the best score 

go with full confidence and go out and give your best 


50 % on coding part and 50% on theory 
bussines skills communications ui , python , java everything 


SOO Many things to learn - 
im confused what to do what to learn 

eveything is given to me im confused - if you are confused 
you are on a right track 

what sir will share it will make sense to us 

remlax take remlax 

EX - Java track 

java - multiple courses 

techincal recordings 
or in practical hands on 
or in pdfs and ppts 

go and open in any one of the course 

now it will makes sense 

But I still dont have an answer 

Morning to evening - how can i DO this 

which one to do and how to solve each and go through every step 

Our curriculum is even less than the curriculum than < class 11 12 highschool 

clas 11 12 will learn easily 

you also can complete it very easily - with flying colours 
95+ 

lightweight baby 

again coming to the problem 

what is the best learning approach 

you gain the expertise to solve the problem 

by practicing more and more 

How to practice and what do you need for practicing 

you dont need too many knoweldege and throey 

you only need some knowledge and 
for every topic 
topic by topic recording is available 

Those Recording is available 

take the 1st recording 

whatever is covered 
 you should practice that in parrel along with the faculty who is explaining 
 it may take quite time 
 but the concept will get solidified 
 you can do by your own 

only if you want to know more about a concept - go more into the content ie pds and ppts 

90 mins + 90 mins 

within 2 and half weeks you can complete all 

then jump into the hands on training section 

1st lean the Technical Recording 

the above approach is the best and it has beem proven and it is practiced by Vishal Himself 
above approach is confident 
Linked - vishal 

always take challenge - prepare and deliver 
Shahid da also 

Less is more in building expertise 

Vishal is soo confident that he can gain knowledge and expertise on a very new technology by 
following this approach which he made by himself 


What about you are interested in advanced technology - ASCEND certification courses 

direct stair for the digital 

also ASCEND hackathons is important 

External certifications is importnat - AWS , AZURE , Oracle , microsoft cloud computing 
all the list will be given to you and if you complete the certifications - you will reimbursed that amount to you 

Azure certifications is very important - Azure Fundamental certificate 

take up certification of your choice 

March - NQT - for digital 

offer can be upgraded to digital 

start preparing right now for the digital - sir will show that 

in the month you appear for digital - you didnt qualified 

Wings 1 will give you chances to upgrade from TCS Ninja to Digital 

Wings 1 assessment is also there 

practice and start implement and dedicate 1 hour every day for learning 

you are doing for yourself - you are increasing your valuation based on your expertise 

Last chance - Innovator TCS 

we do have such examples - from ninja then digital then innovator 

Exceptional career is present in TCS chances is also present 

Expertise you will gain from practicing and being ready and being ahead of the curve 
will help you to increse your valuations 


TCS Next Step - then tcs learning and courses - do the technical learnings 
then if needed then go for ppts and PDFs 

6 jan session for post offer sessions - project account on SAP 

things are uncertain - get married to perspicacious and being ready always 


lets go buoissssss
