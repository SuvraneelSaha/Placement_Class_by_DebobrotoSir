        Difference between abstraction and encapsulation

        abstraction - abstraction is used to present to the end user
        ex - Bank balance to the end user
        How you are doing , not needed
        Focus on what it is doing

        encapsulation - it is meant for the developers
        Focus on what it is doing and also and how it is doing

        protected-           yes            no
        public-              yes            yes



    for protected its only extends to inheritance of a different package
    but when inheritance is not present then it wont - it will give error s


for package - its just a folder
ex -
public repo;
public class test
{
private int x = 10 ;
public void getx()
{
sout(x)
}
// only it is used for printing
// you cant change the value in the var



import repo,*;

class test_demo
{
psvm()
    {
        test obj = new test();
        obj.getx();

    }
}

in cmd
now java test_demo.java
java test_done
