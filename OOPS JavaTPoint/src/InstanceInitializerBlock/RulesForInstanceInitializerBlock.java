    There are mainly three rules for the instance initializer block. They are as follows:

    1]The instance initializer block is created when instance of the class is created. ie when the object is created
    2]The instance initializer block is invoked after the parent class constructor
     is invoked (i.e. after super() constructor call).
    3]The instance initializer block comes in the order in which they appear.
