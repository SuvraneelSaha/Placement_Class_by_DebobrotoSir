    /*
    Polymorphism in Java is a concept
     by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
      Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs.
       The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So polymorphism means many forms.

       There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
       compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.
        We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

        If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism.
