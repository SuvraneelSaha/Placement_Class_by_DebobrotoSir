    Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.
There are two types of binding
    Static Binding (also known as Early Binding).
    Dynamic Binding (also known as Late Binding).

    Static Binding :

    When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler),
    it is known as static binding.
    If there is any private, final or static method in a class, there is static binding.
