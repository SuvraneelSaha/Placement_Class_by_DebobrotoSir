    There are mainly three reasons to use interface. They are given below.

    1]It is used to achieve abstraction.
    2]By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
    3]It can be used to achieve loose coupling.

    /*
    Important Note :
    The Java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method.
     Moreover, it adds public, static and final keywords before data members.

     In other words, Interface fields are public, static and final by default,
      and the methods are public and abstract.
