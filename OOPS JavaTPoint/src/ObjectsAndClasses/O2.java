    1]An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity,
     2] whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only it acts as a blueprint to the objects which are made
     from the classes

     An object has 3 characteristics
     1]
     State - : Represents the data or value of an object

    2]
    Behaviour : Represents the behaviour (functionality) of an object such as deposit or withdraw
                or such as addition or substraction operations
    3] Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.
     The value of the ID is not visible to the external user.
      However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

      ex - For Example, Pen is an object.
       Its name is Reynolds - Identity
       ; color of the pen is blue, known as its state.
        It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.

       What is an Object ?
       An object is an instance of a class.
       ex - a human
       What is an Object?
       A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
       So, an object is the instance(result) of a class.
       ex - of class human class

       Defination of a Object : The object is an instance of a class.

       What is a Class ?
       . It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
        It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.
