    /*
    Encapsulation in Java
    is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
     for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.

     We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private.
     Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

     The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
