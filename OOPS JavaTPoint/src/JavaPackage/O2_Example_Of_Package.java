    /*
    Example of a java package
    So We use ArrayList<> list = new ArrayList();
    so the ArrayList is itself a class and we were making a new object list which is an instance of the Class
    ArrayList

    Now The ArrayList Class is present within the util package
    the util is actually a sub package

    the util package is a sub package which belongs to the Package java

    so whenever we use Arraylist Class we need to need import

    java.util.ArrayList;
